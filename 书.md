|Only Hope: Coming of Age Under China’s One-Child Policy|	Vanessa L. Fong|	[GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76384.Only_Hope)|	Only Hope shows how the one-child policy has largely succeeded in its goals, but with unintended consequences. Only children are expected to be the primary providers of support and care for their retired parents, grandparents, and parents-in-law, and only a very lucrative position will allow them to provide for so many dependents. Many only children aspire to elite status even though few can attain it, and such aspirations lead to increased stress and competition, as well as intense parental involvement.|

|The effects of China’s universal two-child policy |Prof. Yi Zeng, PhD and Prof. Therese Hesketh, PhD| [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5944611/)|In October, 2015, China’s one-child policy was replaced by a universal two-child policy. The effects of the new policy are inevitably speculative, but predictions can be made based on recent trends. The population increase will be relatively small, peaking at 1·45 billion in 2029 (compared with a peak of 1·4 billion in 2023 if the one-child policy continued). The new policy will allow almost all Chinese people to have their preferred number of children. The benefits of the new policy include: a large reduction in abortions of unapproved pregnancies, virtual elimination of the problem of unregistered children, and a more normal sex ratio. All of these effects should improve health outcomes. Effects of the new policy on the shrinking workforce and rapid population ageing will not be evident for two decades. In the meantime, more sound policy actions are needed to meet the social, health, and care needs of the elderly population.|
|The Evolution of China’s One-Child Policy and Its Effects on Family Outcomes | Junsen Zhang |[link](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.31.1.141) | "Although the literature on China’s one-child policy has generally found a statistically significant effect on reducing fertility, most of the studies found the effect to be rather small, especially in the longer-term (Wang et al. 2016). However, this small effect must be understood in the context of the aggressive family planning program in the early 1970s. Given China’s extremely high economic growth after 1979 and the fertility transition experienced in other East Asian countries, China’s further decline of fertility after 1979—which was significantly smaller than what had already occurred during the 1970s—cannot be fully or even mainly attributed to the effect of the one-child policy.
